class BuildSketch(Builder):
    """BuildSketch

    The BuildSketch class is a subclass of Builder for building planar 2D
    sketches (objects with area but not volume) from faces or lines.
    It has an _obj property that returns the current sketch being built.
    The sketch property consists of the sketch(es) applied to the input
    workplanes while the sketch_local attribute is the sketch constructed
    on Plane.XY. The class overrides the solids method of Builder since
    they don't apply to lines.

    Note that all sketch construction is done within sketch_local on Plane.XY.
    When objects are added to the sketch they must be coplanar to Plane.XY,
    usually handled automatically but may need user input for Edges and Wires
    since their construction plane isn't alway able to be determined.

    Args:
        workplanes (Union[Face, Plane, Location], optional): objects converted to
            plane(s) to place the sketch on. Defaults to Plane.XY.
        mode (Mode, optional): combination mode. Defaults to Mode.ADD.
